Feature: Account Registration

User Story:
As a new user of the "HealthFirst" e-commerce website, I want to be able to create an account so that I can join the "Baby Bunting" loyalty family and track my orders.

Description:
The registration process should be simple and secure, requiring a valid email and a strong password. Upon successful registration, the user should be logged in and redirected to the homepage.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Successful Registration:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a unique email address, a valid password, and a matching confirmation password, and click "Create Account", then the system should create the account, log the user in, and display a success message.

2. **Existing Email Error:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter an email address that already exists in the system, then the system should display an inline error message: "This email address is already registered. Please log in."

3. **Invalid Email Format Error:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter an email address in an invalid format (e.g., "user@domain"), then the system should display an inline error message: "Please enter a valid email address."

4. **Password Mismatch Error:** Given a user is on the registration page, when the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields do not match, then the system should display an inline error message: "Passwords do not match."

5. **Weak Password Error:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a password that does not meet the security requirements (less than 8 characters, no number, no special character), then the system should display an inline error message detailing the requirements.

6. **Blank Fields Error:** Given a user is on the registration page, when they attempt to submit the form with any of the required fields left blank, then each blank field should display an error message: "This field is required."

Additional Requirements:
- The registration form should be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Email addresses should be case-insensitive
- The system should prevent rapid successive registration attempts from the same IP
- Upon successful registration, a welcome email should be sent to the user
