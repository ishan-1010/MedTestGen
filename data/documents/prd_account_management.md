- **Security:** The registration endpoint must be protected against CSRF attacks. Input fields must be sanitized to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
- **Compliance (Healthcare Specific):** The user's profile, once created, must have a field for an optional, encrypted "Patient ID" to link with our clinical systems. All user data handling must be compliant with HIPAA guidelines.
